          The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise is one of the most iconic franchises in the history of gaming. As SEGA's mascot, the blue hedgehog is an extremely popular
          character among people of many ages, earning him a spot as a fighter in Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series, which stars video game all-stars.

          You might have heard a lot of things regarding the franchise, especially about the quality of some of the games. There are many divisive 
          opinions on every game in the series, and it is very unlikely for Sonic fans to share the same opinion on a game because everyone started 
          with different games and enjoys different gameplay styles. This website will describe the long history of the franchise, how it has changed over time, 
          and what the current state of the franchise is.
