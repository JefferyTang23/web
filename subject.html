        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          Though it was <a href="https://www.looper.com/15941/sonic-hedgehogs-first-home-console-appearance-probably-missed">not the first video game the blue blur appeared in</a>,
          Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis (or Sega Mega Drive as it is known in other parts of the world) was the start of the Sonic franchise. The game released
          on June 23rd, 1991 and was met with success and popularity because of its stellar soundtrack, graphics, and gameplay. The game allowed SEGA to rival Nintendo and
          their mascot, Mario, and spawned 2 successful sequals, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles.
