        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          Though it was <a href="https://www.looper.com/15941/sonic-hedgehogs-first-home-console-appearance-probably-missed">not the first video game the blue blur appeared in</a>,
          Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis (or Sega Mega Drive as it is known in other parts of the world) was the start of the Sonic franchise. The game released
          on June 23rd, 1991 and was met with success and popularity because of its stellar soundtrack, graphics, and gameplay. The game allowed SEGA to rival Nintendo and
          their mascot, Mario, and spawned two successful sequals: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles.

        <h2>The Late 1990's, the 2000's, and the 2010's</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic's first true 3D game was Sonic Adventure, which released on the SEGA Dreamcast in 1998. Though it and its sequal, Sonic Adventure 2, were relatively successful,
          <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sega-nintendo-rise-fall-90s-genesis-dreamcast-sonic-console-2020-1">SEGA made the decision to back out of the console market</a>. 
          As a result, the Sonic franchise became cross-platform, with its games releasing on Nintendo, Microsoft, and
          Sony consoles. This was the start of when the quality of the games became shaky. From this point on, we got some great games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, 
          but also some that ruined Sonic's reputation, like Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 and Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, and many more that were mediocre or faced mixed reception 
          like Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Forces.
    </p>
        <h2>Sonic's Current State and Future</h2>
        <p>
          Though the most recently released Sonic games, the mainline title Sonic Forces and the spin-off kart-racer Team Sonic Racing, were considered mediocre, people paid
          attention to Sonic once again because of the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. This movie garnered a lot of attention prior to its release because people did not like
          how Sonic looked in the trailer. Since then, the movie was delayed, 
          <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-controversy-and-redesign-explained.html">Sonic's design was changed</a>, 
          and it quickly became the most successful video game movie. This year, 2021, is the 30th anniversary of the franchise and we have a lot to look forward to, like
          the new Netflix show Sonic Prime and the sequal to the Sonic movie both slated for 2022.
