        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
          Though it was <a href="https://www.looper.com/15941/sonic-hedgehogs-first-home-console-appearance-probably-missed">not the first video game the blue blur appeared in</a>,
          Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis (or Sega Mega Drive as it is known in other parts of the world) was the start of the Sonic franchise. The game released
          on June 23rd, 1991 and was met with success and popularity because of its stellar soundtrack, graphics, and gameplay. The game allowed SEGA to rival Nintendo and
          their mascot, Mario, and spawned two successful sequals: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles.

        <p>
          Sonic's first true 3D game was Sonic Adventure, which released on the SEGA Dreamcast in 1998. Though it and its sequal, Sonic Adventure 2, were relatively successful,
          SEGA made the decision to back out of the console market. As a result, the Sonic franchise became cross-platform, with its games releasing on Nintendo, Microsoft, and
          Sony consoles. This was the start of when the quality of the games became shaky. From this point on, we got some great games like Sonic Generations, but also some that
          ruined Sonic's reputation, like Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 and Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, and many that were mediocre or faced mixed reception like Sonic Unleashed, Sonic
          Colors, and Sonic Forces.
