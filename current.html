        <p>
          Though the most recently released Sonic games, the mainline title Sonic Forces and the spin-off kart-racer Team Sonic Racing, were considered mediocre, people paid
          attention to Sonic once again because of the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. This movie garnered a lot of attention prior to its release because people did not like
          how Sonic looked in the trailer. Since then, the movie was delayed, 
          <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-controversy-and-redesign-explained.html">Sonic's design was changed</a>, 
          and it quickly became the most successful video game movie. This year, 2021, is the 30th anniversary of the franchise and we have a lot to look forward to, like
          the new Netflix show Sonic Prime and the sequal to the Sonic movie both slated for 2022.
