    <h2>Sonic's Current State and Future</h2>
        <p>
          Though the most recently released Sonic games, the mainline title Sonic Forces and the spin-off kart-racer Team Sonic Racing, were considered mediocre, people paid
          attention to Sonic once again because of the Sonic the Hedgehog movie. This movie garnered a lot of attention prior to its release because people did not like
          how Sonic looked in the trailer. Since then, the movie was delayed, 
          <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/02/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-controversy-and-redesign-explained.html">Sonic's design was changed</a>, 
          and it quickly became the most successful video game movie.

          Despite both games being revealed at the same time and Sonic Forces having a much higher budget, Forces killed the hype that Sonic Mania brought to the franchise. 
          Developed by makers of Sonic fan-games, Sonic Mania was a return to the classic 2D Sonic formula. The game included classic levels and original levels and received 
          fantastic reviews. However, the release of Sonic Forces killed that excitement with its mediocrity across the board. Forces brought back Classic Sonic with his 2D gameplay 
          and Modern Sonic with his boost gameplay as well as adding a customizable avatar who can't boost but wields Wispons to attack. The game had great potential but it fell flat 
          because of its short and boring levels, resulting in mixed reviews. This year, 2021, is the 30th anniversary of the franchise and we have a lot to look forward to, like
          the new Netflix show Sonic Prime and the sequel to the Sonic movie both slated for 2022.
