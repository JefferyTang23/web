          Though it was <a href="https://www.looper.com/15941/sonic-hedgehogs-first-home-console-appearance-probably-missed">not the first video game the blue blur appeared in</a>,
          Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis (or Sega Mega Drive as it is known in other parts of the world) was the start of the Sonic franchise. The game released
          on June 23rd, 1991 and was met with success and popularity because of its stellar soundtrack, graphics, and gameplay. The game allowed SEGA to rival Nintendo and
          their mascot, Mario, and spawned two successful sequals: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles. These games are commonly referred to as the Classic 
          Era of Sonic.

          Sonic was the only playable character in the first game. The game was a platformer with a physics engine that allowed Sonic to gain more speed 
          as he runs without any interruptions like hitting a wall, falling into a bottomless pit, running into an enemy, or getting hit by spikes. As such, 
          the game is able to reward the player for playing well and being able to avoid obstacles by allowing them to feel the excitment of speeding through 
          levels as the blue hedgehog. Unlike Nintendo's Super Mario, Sonic collects rings instead of coins. Every 100 rings the player is able to get will 
          reward the player with an extra life. However, if Sonic gets hit by an enemy or gets hit by spikes, he will lose all rings in his possession. If Sonic 
          gets hit without any rings, the player will lose a life. Lives can also be lost when Sonic falls into a bottomless pit or is crushed by obstacles.
          When the player reaches the end of a stage with 50 rings or more, they can enter a special stage to obtain one of the 6 Chaose Emeralds.
