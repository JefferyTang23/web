      <h1>The History of Sonic the Hedgehog</h1>
    <h2>The Late 1990's, the 2000's, and the 2010's</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic's first true 3D game was Sonic Adventure, which released on the SEGA Dreamcast in 1998. Though it and its sequal, Sonic Adventure 2, were relatively successful,
          <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sega-nintendo-rise-fall-90s-genesis-dreamcast-sonic-console-2020-1">SEGA made the decision to back out of the console market</a>. 
          As a result, the Sonic franchise became cross-platform, with its games releasing on Nintendo, Microsoft, and
          Sony consoles. This was the start of when the quality of the games became shaky. From this point on, we got some great games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, 
          but also some that ruined Sonic's reputation, like Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 and Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, and many more that were mediocre or faced mixed reception 
          like Sonic Forces.

          While Sonic 3D Blast toyed with the idea of a 3D Sonic game with its top down gameplay, Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast was the first true 3D Sonic game. It managed to 
          capture the gameplay elements of 2D Sonic game and transform them into the third dimension. It incorporated the mechanics of building up speed, the Spindash, and rings. 
          However, that is just Sonic's gameplay style, the game also features 5 other playable character, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Big the Cat, and E-102 Gamma, who each have different gameplay 
          styles and different goals for their stages. Sonic's goal is to  reach the end of the stage. Tails retains his ability to fly and his goal is to reach the end of the stage 
          faster than an AI controlled Sonic or Dr. Eggman. Knuckles can still glide and climb walls and his goal is to find 3 piece of the Master Emerald using a radar system that will 
          flash different colors depending on the player's distance away from each piece of the emerald. Amy is able to swing her hammer to attack and her goal is to reach the end of the 
          stage while an Eggman robot named ZERO chases after her. Her stages are slower and focus more on puzzles and platforming. Big is able to fish when he is near or in a body of water and 
          his goal is to catch his frog friend Froggy in each stage. Instead of counting up, the timer counts down in Gamma's stages and he has to reach the end of the stage before time runs out. 
          However, he is able to lock on to and shoot multiple targets at once with his gun. The more targets he locks on to at one, the more time he will gain upon releasing his shot. The game was generally well received upon its release. 
          However, many people have stated since then that the game has aged poorly with its glitches and gameplay design. Most people find 
          Sonic's gameplay fun, but many do not enjoy the gameplay of the other characters.

          Being the sequal to the first adventure game, Sonic Adventure 2 retains many of the gameplay styles from the first game. The playable characters this time are Sonic, the new 
          fan-favorite character Shadow the Hedgehog, Tails, Dr. Eggman, Knuckles, and the other new character Rouge the Bat. The game is split into 2 stories: the Hero Story where the 
          player takes control of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and the Dark Story, where the player is able to play as Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Rouge. Sonic and Shadow both play just like 
          Sonic did in Sonic Adventure. Tails and Dr. Eggman both pilot mechs in stages and play similarily to how Gamma played in the first adventure game but without the timer counting 
          down and having longer levels. Knuckles and Rouge both play like how Knuckles did in Adventure 1 but the levels are much larger now. Sonic Adventure 2 is generally regarded as being 
          better than Sonic Adventure with how it expanded on gameplay styles from the first game and the introduction of Shadow. However, along with it's predecessor, it faces criticism in 
          recent times for aging poorly. Some also prefer the simpler gameplay of the first game and still some only enjoy the playstyle of Sonic and Shadow.
