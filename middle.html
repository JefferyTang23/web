      <h1>The History of Sonic the Hedgehog</h1>
    <h2>The Late 1990's, the 2000's, and the 2010's</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic's first true 3D game was Sonic Adventure, which was released on the SEGA Dreamcast in 1998. Though it and its sequel, Sonic Adventure 2, were relatively successful,
          <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sega-nintendo-rise-fall-90s-genesis-dreamcast-sonic-console-2020-1">SEGA made the decision to back out of the console market</a>. 
          As a result, the Sonic franchise became cross-platform, with its games releasing on Nintendo, Microsoft, and
          Sony consoles. This was the start of when the quality of the games became shaky. From this point on, we got some great games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, 
          but also some that ruined Sonic's reputation, like Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 and Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, and many more that were mediocre or faced mixed reception 
          like Sonic Forces.

          While Sonic 3D Blast toyed with the idea of a 3D Sonic game with its top-down gameplay, Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast was the first true 3D Sonic game. It managed to 
          capture the gameplay elements of the 2D Sonic games and transform them into the third dimension. It incorporated the mechanics of building up speed, the Spindash, and rings. 
          However, that is just Sonic's gameplay style, the game also features 5 other playable characters, Tails, Knuckles, Amy Rose, Big the Cat, and E-102 Gamma, who each have different gameplay 
          styles and different goals for their stages. Sonic's goal is to  reach the end of the stage. Tails retains his ability to fly and his goal is to reach the end of the stage 
          faster than an AI-controlled Sonic or Dr. Eggman. Knuckles can still glide and climb walls and his goal is to find 3 pieces of the Master Emerald using a radar system that will 
          flash different colors depending on the player's distance away from each piece of the emerald. Amy is able to swing her hammer to attack and her goal is to reach the end of the 
          stage while an Eggman robot named ZERO chases after her. Her stages are slower and focus more on puzzles and platforming. Big is able to fish when he is near or in a body of water and 
          his goal is to catch his frog friend Froggy in each stage. Instead of counting up, the timer counts down in Gamma's stages and he has to reach the end of the stage before time runs out. 
          However, he is able to lock on to and shoot multiple targets at once with his gun. The more targets he locks on to at once, the more time he will gain upon releasing his shot. 
          The game was generally well-received upon its release. 
          However, many people have stated since then that the game has aged poorly with its glitches and gameplay design. Most people find 
          Sonic's gameplay fun, but many do not enjoy the gameplay of the other characters.

          Being the sequel to the first adventure game, Sonic Adventure 2 retains many of the gameplay styles from the first game. The playable characters this time are Sonic, the new 
          fan-favorite character Shadow the Hedgehog, Tails, Dr. Eggman, Knuckles, and the other new character Rouge the Bat. The game is split into 2 stories: the Hero Story where the 
          player takes control of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, and the Dark Story, where the player is able to play as Shadow, Dr. Eggman, and Rouge. Sonic and Shadow both play just like 
          Sonic did in Sonic Adventure. Tails and Dr. Eggman both pilot mechs in stages and play similarly to how Gamma played in the first adventure game but without the timer counting 
          down and having longer levels. Knuckles and Rouge both play like how Knuckles did in Adventure 1 but the levels are much larger now. Sonic Adventure 2 is generally regarded as being 
          better than Sonic Adventure with how it expanded on gameplay styles from the first game and the introduction of Shadow. However, along with its predecessor, it faces criticism in 
          recent times for aging poorly. Some also prefer the simpler gameplay of the first game and still, some only enjoy the playstyle of Sonic and Shadow.

          Released for the Gamecube and Xbox, Sonic Heroes features its own unique team based gameplay style. Each team has a speed character (Sonic, Shadow, Amy, and Espio), a 
          flying character (Tails, Rouge, Cream, and Charmy), and a power character (Knuckles, Omega, Big, and Vector). The gameplay revolves around switching between characters to 
          get past different obstacles in stages. This game had a mixed reception because of its long levels (most levels take around 5 to 10 minutes to complete), numerous glitches, 
          and slippery controls.

          Sonic the Hedgehog (2006) was the 15th-anniversary Sonic game and the game that made Sonic a laughingstock of a franchise. It borrowed gameplay elements from the Adventure 
          games but it was nowhere as polished as them. With 9 total playable characters, critics hated the multiple gameplay styles more than ever. Being a rushed game, it contains 
          tons of game-breaking glitches and unfinished content. It was frequently made fun of for its long and frequent loading screens. It received terrible reviews upon its release 
          and remains a stain on the history of the franchise. Recently, select Sonic fans have stated to liking the game despite how it is a rushed mess because it had ambition, something 
          they felt newer Sonic games lacked.

          Sonic Unleashed was the start of a new gameplay style for the franchise. After receiving criticism for having too many gameplay styles in previous 3D games, Sonic Team made 
          Sonic the only playable character in Unleashed. However, there were still 2 gameplay styles in the game. In the daytime, the gameplay is based on the boost, where the boost gauge 
          is filled by defeating enemies and collecting rings. When the boost button is pressed, Sonic will be surrounded in a blue aura and run and grind much faster. The boost gameplay 
          relies on the player's ability to maintain the boost gauge to continuously boost throughout the stage. At night, Sonic turns into the Werehog, whose gameplay revolves around combat like 
          God of War and slow and tight platforming. The game initially received mixed reviews because many people liked the boost gameplay but found the Werehog levels long and unenjoyable. 
          Recently, it is hailed as one of the best Sonic games by some and many wish for the game to be ported to PC.

          Having taken criticism from Unleashed into consideration, the boost formula was the only gameplay style in Sonic Colors. As a result, it was the first critically acclaimed 
          Sonic game since Sonic Adventure 2. In recent days, however, many people in the Sonic community expressed that Colors is a mediocre game because of its abundance of 2D sections 
          and blocky platforming and for its introduction of the Wisp powerups.

          With the release of Sonic Generations, Sonic fans were in for a treat for the hedgehog's 20th anniversary. For this milestone, they brought back the classic 2D gameplay style by 
          bringing back Classic Sonic as a playable character. Modern Sonic uses the boost formula for his stages. In this blast from the past, iconic stages and bosses from mainline Sonic games 
          with reimagined level design and visuals suitable for both the boost and 2D playstyle. The game received great reviews and is still viewed as one of the best in the franchise, with 
          it being the last good 3D Sonic game in many people's eyes.

          In the dismay of many people, Sonic Team moved away from the boost formula for Sonic Lost World. It is most similar to the Sonic and Shadow in the adventure games but is still quite 
          different from anything in the series. The controls include a run button and there is a new parkour mechanic. The game faced mixed reception as a result of people thinking it is trying 
          to rip off Super Mario Galaxy and because the parkour system is complicated and difficult to use in the game's poorly designed levels.

        Sonic Boom was meant to be a spin-off series, but the release of Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric both started and effectively killed it. Much like Sonic the Hedgehog (2006), this game 
        was a glitchy mess and made the franchise a laughingstock once more. With its game-breaking glitches upon release, it got horrible reviews, with some saying that it is worse than 
        Sonic 2006. Though the Sonic Boom TV show and the 3DS game Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice were relatively successful, the Sonic Boom series was quietly put to rest because of how much 
        Rise of Lyric had tarnished the name.
