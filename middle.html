      <h1>Jeffery Tang- Sonic the Hedgehog</h1>
    <h2>The Late 1990's, the 2000's, and the 2010's</h2>
        <p>
          Sonic's first true 3D game was Sonic Adventure, which released on the SEGA Dreamcast in 1998. Though it and its sequal, Sonic Adventure 2, were relatively successful,
          <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sega-nintendo-rise-fall-90s-genesis-dreamcast-sonic-console-2020-1">SEGA made the decision to back out of the console market</a>. 
          As a result, the Sonic franchise became cross-platform, with its games releasing on Nintendo, Microsoft, and
          Sony consoles. This was the start of when the quality of the games became shaky. From this point on, we got some great games like Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania, 
          but also some that ruined Sonic's reputation, like Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 and Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, and many more that were mediocre or faced mixed reception 
          like Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Forces.
